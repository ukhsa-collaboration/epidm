# Respeciated organisms

Occasionally, research shows that two organisms, previously thought to
be different are in fact one and the same. The reverse is also true.
This is a manually updated list. If there are organisms missing, or new
respeciates to be added, please raise and issue or push request on the
[epidm GitHub](https://github.com/alexbhatt/epidm)
