\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{data.table} with patient identifiers.}

\item{id}{A \strong{named list} of quoted column names:
\describe{
\item{\code{nhs_number}}{NHS number.}
\item{\code{hospital_number}}{Local patient identifier (hospital number).}
\item{\code{date_of_birth}}{Date of birth.}
\item{\code{sex_mfu}}{Sex/gender (M/F/Unknown).}
\item{\code{forename}}{Forename / first name.}
\item{\code{surname}}{Surname / last name.}
\item{\code{postcode}}{Patient postcode.}
}}

\item{.useStages}{optional, default 1:11; set to 1 if you wish patient ID to
be assigned cases with the same DOB and NHS number, set to 2 if you wish patient
ID to be assigned to cases with the same hospital number (HOS) and DOB, set to
3 if you wish patient ID to be assigned cases with the same NHS and HOS number,
set to 4 if you wish patient ID to be assigned cases with the same NHS number
and surname, set to 5 if you wish patient ID to be assigned cases with the same
hospital number and surname, set to 6 if you wish patient ID to be assigned
cases with the same DOB and surname, set to 7 if you wish patient ID to be
assigned cases with the same sex and full name, set to 8 if you wish patient
ID to be assigned cases with the same sex, DOB and fuzzy name, set to 9 if you
wish patient ID to be assigned cases with the same DOB and fuzzy name, set to
10 if you wish patient ID to be assigned cases with the same name and postcode,
set to 11 if you wish patient ID to be assigned cases with the same first name
or second name in changing order and date of birth.}

\item{.keepStages}{optional, default FALSE; to generate a new column (stageMatch)
to retain the stage information for which the record matched the group.}

\item{.keepValidNHS}{optional, default FALSE; set TRUE if you wish to retain
the column with the NHS checksum result stored as a BOOLEAN}

\item{.sortOrder}{optional; a column as a character to allow a sorting
order on the id generation}

\item{.forceCopy}{optional, default FALSE; TRUE will force data.table to take a copy
instead of editing the data without reference}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with the original columns plus:
\describe{
\item{\code{id}}{Integer patient identifier assigned by staged matching.}
\item{\code{valid_nhs}}{(Optional) BOOLEAN NHS checksum flag; included when \code{.keepValidNHS = TRUE}.}
}
}

Assigns a \strong{single integer \code{id}} to records that belong to the same patient by
applying a sequence of \strong{deterministic matching stages} across common identifiers
(NHS number, hospital number, DOB, name, sex, postcode). Identifiers are
standardised, validated using NHS checksum function, and fuzzy name keys are
used in later stages.
'
Matching is performed in order through the following stages (first match is applied):
\enumerate{
\item NHS number + date of birth
\item Hospital number + date of birth
\item NHS number + hospital number
\item NHS number + surname
\item Hospital number + surname
\item Date of birth + surname (only where NHS is invalid/absent)
\item Sex + full name (forename + surname)
\item Sex + date of birth + fuzzy name (Soundex; surname + initial)
\item Date of birth (YYYY-MM) + fuzzy name
\item Surname/forename + postcode
\item Name swaps (forename/surname reversed) + date of birth
}

Use \code{.useStages} to restrict which stages are applied (default: \code{1:11}).
The function generates a reproducible \code{id} per patient within the sort order;
you can provide \code{.sortOrder} (e.g., a date column) to make assignment deterministic.

\strong{Validity rules applied:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{NHS number} validated using the standard checksum (\code{epidm::valid_nhs()}).
\item \strong{Hospital number}: excludes known placeholders (e.g., \code{"UNKNOWN"}, \code{"NO PATIENT ID"}).
\item \strong{DOB}: excludes proxy or missing dates (\code{"1900-01-01"}, \code{"1800-01-01"}, \code{NA}).
\item \strong{Sex}: normalised to \code{"M"} / \code{"F"}; others → \code{NA}.
\item \strong{Names}: uppercased, Latin characters normalised; Soundex used for fuzzy matching.
}

Identifiers are copied over where they are missing or invalid to the grouped
records.

\section{Workflow context}{

\code{uk_patient_id()} is typically used early to harmonise patient identity
across isolates before downstream tasks such as specimen episode grouping
(\code{group_time()}), dataset linkage (e.g., to HES/SUS/ECDS), and
epidemiological reporting.
