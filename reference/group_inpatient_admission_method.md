# Inpatient admission methods

In order to group hospital inpatient admissions into human readable
groups, a lookup table has been created. These work with Hospital
Episode Statistics (HES) and Secondary Use Services (SUS) data with the
admission_method fields.

## Usage

``` r
group_inpatient_admission_method
```

## Format

- code:

  the admission_method code

- admission_method:

  the admission_method grouping as a human readable string
