# Inpatient discharge destination

In order to group hospital inpatient discharge destination into human
readable groups, a lookup table has been created. These work with
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Secondary Use Services (SUS) data
with the discharge_destination fields.

## Usage

``` r
group_inpatient_discharge_destination
```

## Format

- code:

  the discharge_destination code

- discharge_destination:

  the discharge_destination grouping as a human readable string
